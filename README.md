## Instructions

- To run this app add a .env.local file with an OpenAI key: OPENAI_API_KEY=XXX

## Explanation

- shadCN is my preferred UI library for longer term projects. I chose daisyUI for this as it has more styling out of the box, so allows me to achieve more in a few hours.
- I used Valtio for state management. Valtio does come with some gotchas due to its use of proxies. But i'm fastest with it so it's great for iterating / when time is short.

## TODO

- explore issues with pdf parsing library.
- consider not using the ai library.
- cross browser test
- mobile optimize
